Dear Sir 
I am writing to request leave on Monday and Tuesday to complete the process of collecting important documents from my college. I recently took leave to address this matter, but due to Diwali holidays and unforeseen issues at the college, I was unable to finalize the document collection.
These documents are crucial for Next process and require my personal presence to resolve. I apologize for any inconvenience this additional leave may cause and appreciate your understanding. I have ensured my tasks are on schedule and will work diligently to make up for any missed time.

I plan to return to the office on Wednesday and will focus on completing any outstanding work promptly.

Thank you for your support and consideration.

Best regards,
Jayesh Patil
